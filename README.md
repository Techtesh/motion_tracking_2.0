# motion_tracking_2.0
after deploying the previous project (https://github.com/Techtesh/motion_Tracking) on an rpi0-cam and sitting through the output i saw a no of errors and bugs ,this project aims at solving those (and if there are no updates ,that means i am continuing one of my 9 billion other projects and would get to this one soon tm)
